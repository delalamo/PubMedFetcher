# PubMedFetcher
This repo contains the code I use for fetching new papers every morning that might interest me. The good stuff is in `run.py`. Right now (as of 9 September 2025) the main script is called daily via Github Actions and fetches abstracts from biorxiv, chemrxiv, medrxiv, arxiv (the bio-ml and stats sections only), and PubMed. These are then embedded using the OpenAI API, assigned a score using a custom-trained logistic regression model, and summarized by GPT-5-nano if deemed to be relevant. Then the script emails me all abstracts above a certain threshold, ranked by score, at midnight GMT. The whole setup is free to run on the cloud with Github Actions, though there is the cost of calculating OpenAI embeddings of about $0.02 per day.

## How to use this repo
1. Fork this repo
2. Add the following secrets under Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions:
    * MY_EMAIL: Your email
    * MY_PW: An app password assigned by your email client (not your actual email password!)
    * OPENAI_API_KEY: The API Key for OpenAI used to calculate embeddings and generate summaries.
3. Optional: setup your logistic regression model using setup_regression_model.py (TODO) 

#### TODO
- [ ] Include pre-computed embeddings of negative examples
- [ ] Move cutoff option to main()

#### Retraining the logistic regression model
The logistic regression model used here was trained on approximately 900 positive examples of papers that interest me, and 9000 negative examples that are a randomly assembled mix of abstracts from pubmed fetch from [the github repo associated with this manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2024.100968). The difficult part of retraining the model used to identify papers of interest is finding the positive examples; once those are obtained, however, the model can be trained as follows

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')) # you key goes here

# dda_scripts is the repo I keep with the training data (positives/negatives)
df = pd.read_csv("dda_scripts/extras/annotated_abstracts.tsv", sep="\t").dropna(subset="label")
labels, reps, prompt = [], [], []
for i, row in df.iterrows():
  prompt.append(row["abstract"])
  labels.append(row["label"])
  if i % 100 == 0 and i > 0: # to avoid sending too many tokens
    response = client.embeddings.create(
        input=prompt,
        model="text-embedding-3-small"
    )
    for d in response.data:
      reps.append(np.asarray(d.embedding[:512]))
    prompt = []
if len(prompt) > 0:
  response = client.embeddings.create(
        input=prompt,
        model="text-embedding-3-small"
    )
  for d in response.data:
    reps.append(np.asarray(d.embedding[:512]))
clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=0, max_iter=10000).fit(reps, labels)
import pickle
with open('model_openai_512.pkl','wb') as f:
  pickle.dump(clf,f)
```
